# Flutter BLoC Architecture Guide for Beginners

## Introduction to Flutter File Architecture

When building Flutter applications, having a **structured file architecture** is important for **maintainability, scalability, and readability**. Without a proper structure, the code can become unmanageable as the project grows.

### **Unstructured Project (Bad Practice)**
```
/lib
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart
  â”œâ”€â”€ home_screen.dart
  â”œâ”€â”€ counter_bloc.dart
  â”œâ”€â”€ counter_event.dart
  â”œâ”€â”€ counter_state.dart
  â”œâ”€â”€ some_api_calls.dart
  â”œâ”€â”€ another_screen.dart
```
- Files are scattered and difficult to manage.
- Business logic is mixed with UI code.
- Difficult to scale and maintain.

### **Structured Project (Good Practice)**
```
/lib
  â”œâ”€â”€ /bloc         # BLoC files (events, states, bloc classes)
  â”œâ”€â”€ /models       # Data models
  â”œâ”€â”€ /repositories # API or database interactions
  â”œâ”€â”€ /screens      # UI Screens
  â”œâ”€â”€ /widgets      # Reusable components
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart
```
- Organized structure for better maintainability.
- Separates business logic from UI.
- Easier to scale and collaborate.

## **What is BLoC?**

BLoC (**Business Logic Component**) is a state management solution in Flutter. It **separates business logic from UI**, making the app **more scalable, testable, and maintainable**.

### **Why BLoC?**
âœ… **Separates UI & Logic** â€“ Helps in clean code architecture.
âœ… **Scalable** â€“ Suitable for large applications.
âœ… **Testable** â€“ Easy to test business logic independently.
âœ… **Reusability** â€“ Use the same logic in multiple places.

## **Understanding the BLoC Architecture Layers**

### **Folder Structure Overview**

```
/lib
  â”œâ”€â”€ /bloc         # BLoC files (events, states, bloc classes)
  â”œâ”€â”€ /models       # Data models
  â”œâ”€â”€ /repositories # API or database interactions
  â”œâ”€â”€ /screens      # UI Screens
  â”œâ”€â”€ /widgets      # Reusable components
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart
```

### **Folder Explanations**
- **/bloc** â†’ Handles business logic (events, states, bloc classes)
- **/models** â†’ Defines data models used in the app
- **/repositories** â†’ Manages API calls and data handling
- **/screens** â†’ Contains UI screens
- **/widgets** â†’ Stores reusable UI components


Happy coding! ðŸš€
