# Flutter Firebase E-Commerce Project

## Project Overview
This project is designed to help beginners understand Firebase integration in a Flutter e-commerce application. The project will include three main features:
- **Authentication**: Users should be able to register, log in, and log out using Firebase Authentication.
- **Database**: Store and retrieve product details and user-related data using Firebase Firestore.
- **Push Notifications**: Implement Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send notifications about new products or offers.
