# Dart For Loop Practice Questions

This repository contains practical Dart for loop questions designed to help you strengthen your understanding of loops in Dart programming.

## ðŸ“Œ For Loop Questions

### 1. Print numbers divisible by 4
Write a Dart program that uses a for loop to print all numbers between `10` and `30` that are divisible by `4`.

### 2. Filter numbers greater than 10
Use a for loop to iterate through a list of integers `[3, 7, 10, 15, 18, 20]` and print only the numbers greater than `10`.

### 3. Find numbers divisible by both 3 and 5
Write a for loop that prints all numbers between `1` and `50` that are divisible by both `3` and `5`.

### 4. Filter names based on character length
Given a list of names `["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"]`, write a for loop to print names that have more than `4` characters.

### 5. Count numbers greater than 10
Write a for loop to count how many numbers in the list `[5, 12, 8, 20, 15, 30]` are greater than `10` and print the count.

### 6. Sum of even numbers
Write a for loop that calculates the sum of all even numbers between `1` and `100` and prints the result.

### 7. Reverse a list using a for loop
Given a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, use a for loop to reverse the list and print the reversed list.

### 8. Print multiplication table
Write a Dart program that asks the user for a number and prints the multiplication table for that number up to `10` using a for loop.

### 9. Find prime numbers in a range
